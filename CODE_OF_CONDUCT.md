# Code of Conduct (CoC)

## TL;DR
You can do whatever you want.

## Our Pledge
We respect each other. Disagreements happen all the time but we will try to solve it peacefully, not by censoring but by debating and talking. We mainly care about quality, not quantity. We do not care what you said outside of this project, we care about what you said here. 

## Our Standards
Please obey the law where you are living, don't do anything illegal. You should know how to treat others.

>Respect should be earned. -Linus Torvalds.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are project maintainers.

Contributors are contributors.

Users are users.

All changes and feedback are welcomed and we will always listen.

## Scope
Here and only here. You can do whatever you want on social media. We have no control whatsoever on what you said about us.

## Enforcement
No one cares to enforce this CoC. There is no law enforcement here. If you are, please do it.

## Note
This is a shortened, simplified and heavily modified version of the original CoC. WTFPL verion 2 clause 0 also applies here. We have to write this because they tell us we need a CoC.
